Chapter 1: The Locked Gate

It was a quiet Saturday afternoon when Laila and her friends stumbled upon the old gate at the far end of the park.
Covered in ivy and rust, it looked like no one had touched it in years.
Youssef reached out to jiggle the handle, but it didn’t budge—it was locked tight.
“What do you think is back there?” Mariam whispered, eyes wide with curiosity.
Omar noticed strange markings carved into the stone wall beside the gate—symbols none of them could recognize.
A cool breeze passed through the trees, making the gate creak softly.
“We have to find a way in,” Laila said, determination in her voice.
They agreed to meet the next day, each one tasked with finding any clue about the gate.
That night, Laila dreamed of a garden full of glowing flowers and whispering shadows.
When she woke up, she knew the adventure had already begun.
