Chapter 5: An Unexpected Visitor
Mary explored the long, dim corridors of Misselthwaite Manor, each step echoing through the silence.
One night, she paused, certain she heard a distant cryâ€”soft, sorrowful, and hidden deep within the house. 
Curiosity burned in her, leading her to question what secrets the great house kept. 
Whispers of a locked room, a crying voice, and a forgotten garden stirred in her mind. 
Outside, the garden gate stood closed and ivy-covered, holding back memories of joy and loss.
Though no one spoke of it, Mary felt the place calling to her. The mystery had begun to bloom like spring itself.
