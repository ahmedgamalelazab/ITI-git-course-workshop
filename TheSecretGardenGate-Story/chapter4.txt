Chapter 4: The Garden’s Secret
In this chapter, Mary Lennox becomes more curious about the mysterious locked garden at Misselthwaite Manor. 
After hearing more stories from Martha, the maid, about the late Mrs. Craven and her love for the walled garden, 
Mary is determined to find it. She explores the grounds on her own, wandering through the gardens and searching for clues.
During her walk, she befriends a curious robin who seems to guide her toward something hidden. Eventually,
the robin leads her to a patch of freshly turned earth—and there, buried beneath it, Mary finds a small, rusty key.
She becomes convinced that it must open the door to the secret garden.
