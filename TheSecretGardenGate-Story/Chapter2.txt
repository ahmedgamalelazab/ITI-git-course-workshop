Chapter 2: The Hidden Key

While exploring the quiet garden, they noticed strange symbols carved into the bark of an old tree.
Curious and unsure, they brushed aside the fallen leaves at its base and began to dig with their hands.

Their fingers struck something cold and metallic.

Buried just a few inches below the surface, they uncovered a small, rusty key.
It looked ancient, its surface worn and twisted, as if it had been waiting for years to be found.

The tree above seemed to whisper as the wind passed through its branches.

Near the spot, a flat stone had a symbol that matched the carvings on the keyâ€™s handle.
Was it a sign? A warning? Or an invitation?

They looked at each other, uncertain.

There was no lock in sight. No door. Just silence, and the faint scent of old earth.

Still holding the key tightly, they stood up.
