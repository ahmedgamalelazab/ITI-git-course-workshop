Introduction

In a quiet town nestled between winding hills and sleepy streets, 
a group of curious kids stumbles upon a rusty, 
overgrown gate hidden deep in the neighborhood park.
Locked tight and long forgotten, the gate seems ordinary at first—until strange symbols and an odd breeze raise more questions than answers. 
What lies beyond that gate could change their summer… and their friendship… forever.
