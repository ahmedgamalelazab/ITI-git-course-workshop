Chapter 3: Into the Garden

With trembling hands, the group fit the mysterious key into the rusty lock. After a moment of resistance, there was a soft click, and the gate creaked open, revealing a world unlike anything they had ever seen.

The garden inside was overgrown but enchanting. Wildflowers in colors no one could name bloomed wildly between tangled vines and gnarled trees. Strange plants with leaves that shimmered faintly in the sunlight grew alongside bushes heavy with berries of every shade.

In the center of the garden stood a stone fountain, covered in moss and ivy, but still majestic. The water was crystal clear and reflected the soft patterns carved into the fountain’s base — curious shapes that seemed almost like a code. The friends gathered quietly, feeling a mix of awe and wonder.

Birdsong floated through the air, and an occasional breeze carried hints of jasmine and something else, something unfamiliar but sweet. It was a secret place, forgotten by time, and somehow, it was theirs to explore.
